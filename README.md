## 💡 About Me
I am a **Computer Science PhD student at North Carolina State University**, advised by **Dr. Jiajia Li**.  
My research interests lie in **high-performance computing (HPC)**, **numerical optimization**, and **AI acceleration**.  

Previously, I completed my **B.S. in Mathematics** at **Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)**, where I gained hands-on experience in **supercomputing competitions**, **parallel programming**, and **large-scale AI model optimization**.  

I’m passionate about **bridging applied mathematics and system-level design** — building faster, smarter computing systems through innovations in **tensor computation**, **floating-point representation**, and **parallel frameworks**.
